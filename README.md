#UDACITY DATA SCIENTIST NANODEGREE PROJECT 1

#1.Project Name - Wine_quality
This Project predicts wine quality using Multiple Linear Regression.
Also evaluates the performance of the model.

#Installations
This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:

scikit-learn==0.21.2
pandas==0.24.2
numpy==1.16.4
matplotlib==3.1.0
seaborn==0.9.0
You will also need to have software installed to run and execute an iPython Notebook

install Anaconda, a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.

#Project Motivation

As per Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree project  we have to write a Data science blogpost using CRISP-DM.

I was intriguted to analyze and find the quality of the wine of the data given other features like alcohol,sulphates etc.
This projects analyzes the corelation of quality with other features and use the most correlated feature to predict the quality of the wine. 

This can can be modified to analyze other data sets other than amsterdam data.

for more information refer to the medium blogpost for this project: https://medium.com/@goutam.ghadai2199/linear-regression-in-python-with-scikit-learn-36d293e15b98

#Run
In a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory Write_BlogPost/ (that contains this README) and run one of the following commands:

ipython notebook **wine_quality_prediction.ipynb**
or

jupyter **wine_quality_prediction.ipynb**
This will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your browser.
